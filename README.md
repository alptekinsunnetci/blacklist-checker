# Blacklist Checker

A high-performance DNS-based blackhole list (DNSBL) checker written in Go. This tool checks if IP addresses or /24 subnets are listed in various DNSBLs.

## Features

- Check individual IP addresses or /24 subnets
- Configurable concurrency and timeout settings
- Support for custom DNSBL lists
- Multiple output formats (JSON and text)
- Detailed error reporting
- Performance optimized DNS lookups
- Configurable through command-line flags and config file

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alptekinsunnetci/blacklist-checker.git
cd blacklist-checker
go build
```

## Usage

Basic usage:
```bash
./blacklist-checker <IP> or <subnet/24>
```

With options:
```bash
./blacklist-checker -config custom_config.json -format text <IP> or <subnet/24>
```

### Command-line Options

- `-config`: Path to configuration file (default: config.json)
- `-format`: Output format (json or text, default: json)

### Configuration File

The configuration file (config.json) supports the following options:

```json
{
  "concurrency": 100,
  "timeout": 3,
  "blacklists": [
    "access.redhawk.org",
    "b.barracudacentral.org",
    ...
  ],
  "output_format": "json",
  "custom_blacklists": []
}
```

## Output

The tool generates a timestamped output file in the specified format. The filename follows the pattern:
`<IP-or-subnet>_<timestamp>.<format>`

### JSON Output Example
```json
{
  "192.168.1.1": [
    "dnsbl.sorbs.net",
    "bl.spamcop.net"
  ]
}
```

### Text Output Example
```
IP: 192.168.1.1
Blacklisted in:
  - dnsbl.sorbs.net
  - bl.spamcop.net
```

## Performance

The tool is optimized for performance with:
- Configurable concurrency limits
- Efficient DNS lookups
- Goroutine-based parallel processing
- Memory-efficient result collection
