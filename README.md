# Blacklist Checker

## Overview

This Go application checks whether a given IP address or a /24 subnet is blacklisted across multiple DNS-based blacklists. The application takes either a single IP address or a /24 subnet as input and outputs the blacklisted IPs into a JSON file.

## Features

- Supports both single IP addresses and /24 subnets as input.
- Checks IPs against a wide range of DNS-based blacklists.
- Outputs the results in a JSON format, grouped by IP address with their corresponding blacklists.
- Handles concurrent DNS lookups with a limit on the number of concurrent requests.
- Supports automatic generation of output filenames with timestamps.

## Prerequisites

- Go version 1.16 or higher.
- Access to the internet to perform DNS lookups.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alptekisunnetci/blacklist-checker.git
   cd blacklist-checker
   ```

2. **Build the Go application:**

   ```bash
   go build -o blacklist_checker main.go
   ```

3. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   ./blacklist_checker <IP> or <subnet/24>
   ```

   Replace `<IP>` with the IP address or `<subnet/24>` with the subnet you want to check. For example:
   - `./blacklist_checker 218.92.0.211`
   - `./blacklist_checker 218.92.0.0/24`

## Usage

The application supports the following input formats:

- **Single IP address:** Provide an IP address as an argument. The format should be in the standard IPv4 format (e.g., `218.92.0.211`).
- **/24 Subnet:** Provide a subnet in CIDR format (e.g., `218.92.0.0/24`). Only `/24` subnets are supported.

### Example Commands

- Checking a single IP address:
  
  ```bash
  ./blacklist_checker 218.92.0.211
  ```

- Checking a subnet:

  ```bash
  ./blacklist_checker 218.92.0.0/24
  ```

## Output

- The application generates a JSON file with the results of the blacklist check.
- The output file is named in the format `subnet_or_ip_timestamp.json`, where `subnet_or_ip` is the provided input (with `/` replaced by `-`), and `timestamp` is the current timestamp.

Example filename: `218.92.0.0-24_20230514_153000.json`

### JSON Output Structure

The JSON output will contain a list of IPs as keys, with their respective blacklists as values.

Example:

```json

## Concurrency and Performance

- The application uses goroutines to perform concurrent DNS lookups, with a limit on the number of concurrent requests (`50` by default).
- You can adjust the concurrency by modifying the `concurrency` variable in the `main` function.
